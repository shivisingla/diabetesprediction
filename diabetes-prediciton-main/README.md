### <b> Diabetes-Prediciton </b>
<br>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and, over time, leads to severe damage to many of the bodyâ€™s systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.<br>

This a ML web app deployed on heroku; it takes several input from user and then predicts if user has diabetes or not<br>
  Novelty:<br>
  Machine learning techniques with implemented web technologies for diabetes management and control. It identifies the strengths and weaknesses of such systems. <br>It proposes a novel method using the KNN machine learning algorithm as the core for food recommendation model with its associated modules for food recognition from images and calculation of calorie intake, development of chatbots using natural language processing for answering questions on diabetes, and offering general education on diabetes management, which is crucial.
